# AuroraArc
This project is in extremely early phases.  Unless interested in contributing, I would look elsewhere.

Hopefully given enough time this will first function as a basic (not noteworthy) mysql jdbc driver.  Once functioning well there, it will continue to be extended to take advantage of Amazon's aurora database's specific failover functionality as well as secondary read capabilities.

The end goal is to have a light weight (though not necessairly dependency free), high performance driver focused around amazon aurora's functionality.  If future similar databases come out in the future we may expand this project to handle their specific functionality as well (google I am looking at you).
